# Review of php[architect] February 2025

I had the chance to dive into the February 2025 issue of *php[architect]*. While I personally found this issue slightly weaker compared to previous editions, it still offered some valuable insights and thought-provoking pieces. Hereâ€™s my detailed breakdown:

---

## The CMS Plateau by Andrew Woods

### Summary
Andrew Woods explores the current state of CMS platforms, arguing that we've hit a plateau in CMS innovation. He walks us through how early CMS systems revolutionized content management but highlights the lack of meaningful progress recently. He suggests improvements like better link management, HTTP status codes usage, discoverability enhancements, archiving capabilities, reputation evaluation, and implementing Webmention support.

### Commentary & Critique
This article mirrored my own perception perfectlyâ€”CMS development seems stuck. Woods does a good job pointing out the areas needing innovation, especially in handling links, archiving, and accessibility. However, one area missing in his analysis is the rise of **low-code/no-code platforms**. In my view, the stagnation of traditional CMSs is partially due to the explosive growth of these tools, which are solving different but related problems in a more dynamic way.

His mention of **Brandoliniâ€™s Law** was a refreshing reminder that moderation features like Webmention could help mitigate noise and misinformation.

### Recommendation
Highly recommended for developers reflecting on CMS relevance today and wanting to think about where innovation might still come from.

## Distributed Tracing in PHP Using OpenTelemetry by Nelson Isioma

### Summary
Nelson provides a clear, hands-on introduction to distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry (OTel). He breaks down key concepts like spans, traces, metrics, and exporters, demonstrates integration with Laravel apps, and shows how to visualize traces using Zipkin.

### Commentary & Critique
Excellent practical guide! This article hits close to home, as I've been following observability trends for years. It feels like OpenTelemetry is finally becoming a **de facto standard**. His example-driven approach is very accessible, and I believe **observability** should be a mission for every development teamâ€”not just ops.

### Recommendation
A must-read for any PHP developer wanting to professionalize monitoring practices.

## Too Much Focus can be Detrimental by Eric Mann

### Summary
Eric uses the story of a physics professor rediscovering the well-known Leidenfrost effect to make a broader point: extreme specialization and focus can trap developers in an echo chamber. He advocates for T-shaped generalists who step outside their niche.

### Commentary & Critique
The story was brilliantâ€”exactly the kind of illustrative example that sticks with you. It reminds me of how important it is to look beyond immediate problems and stay curious. For development teams, this is a valuable reminder to encourage **out-of-the-box thinking** and broader exploration.

### Recommendation
A concise yet impactful article. Highly recommended.

## Jumping into LLMs With Prism by Scott Keck-Warren

### Summary
Scott introduces the **Prism** Laravel package, which simplifies integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into PHP applications. He walks through how to generate basic responses, use structured output, and even integrate custom tool calls.

### Commentary & Critique
This is a useful tip for anyone working with Laravel and LLMs. However, I expected a slightly deeper diveâ€”perhaps on prompt engineering strategies or advanced use cases. Nevertheless, the article is practical and lowers the barrier to entry for AI integration.

### Recommendation
Useful for Laravel developers wanting to experiment with LLMs quickly.

---

## Anatomy of a Modern PHP Class by Chris Tankersley

### Summary
Chris presents what a modern PHP class looks like today, leveraging PHP 8.4â€™s features such as typed properties, constructor property promotion, and new syntactic sugar.

### Commentary & Critique
Solid overview! This is a nice refresher for anyone wanting to ensure their PHP classes are clean, modern, and maintainable.

### Recommendation
Definitely worth reading for developers looking to stay current with PHPâ€™s evolution.

---

## Powering PHPâ€™s Growth (The Zend Engine) by Christopher Miller

### Summary
Christopher dives into the history and role of the Zend Engine in PHPâ€™s development, explaining its significance and evolution.

### Commentary & Critique
While informative, this felt more like a **reminder of past knowledge**. Still, itâ€™s a useful piece for PHP newcomers unfamiliar with the core engine's role.

### Recommendation
Good for those interested in PHP internals, though may feel basic to veterans.

---

## Story Maps by Edward Barnard

### Summary
Edward explores the use of story maps for project planning, referencing key ideas from XP like "Card, Conversation, Confirmation." He emphasizes how story mapping aids in understanding user needs collaboratively.

### Commentary & Critique
The connection to XP principles was well done, making the concept practical and tangible.

### Recommendation
A valuable read for anyone involved in product planning or team collaboration.

---

## Dockerized Client with PSR-6 HTTP Caching by Oscar Merida

### Summary
Oscar provides a step-by-step guide to setting up a Dockerized PHP client, with PSR-6 HTTP caching, explaining Xdebug and PHP extensions setup.

### Commentary & Critique
A very thorough walkthrough. I particularly liked how it avoided common tools like **Lando** or **DDev**, offering a more "barebones" approach. That said, for developers preferring these tools, theyâ€™re still worth mentioning.

### Recommendation
Highly recommended for anyone looking to understand Docker setups beyond managed environments.

---

## Adding Individuals With A Disability to Your Team by Maxwell Ivey

### Summary
Maxwell advocates for inclusivity in hiring, reminding us that team diversity extends beyond just skills and demographics to include people with disabilities.

### Commentary & Critique
This is such an important message. Often, we underestimate how different and humbling another person's daily challenges can be. Including these perspectives strengthens teams both technically and culturally.

### Recommendation
A must-read, period.

---

## The Developer Experience by Chris Hartjes

### Summary
Chris kicks off his new column by focusing on the developer experience (DX), emphasizing consistent tooling, editor choice, and environment setup. His key message: minimizing friction helps developers contribute faster.

### Commentary & Critique
I fully agreeâ€”particularly with his point about having a **mono-culture for editors/IDEs**. Sharing configurations lowers onboarding time and improves team cohesion.

### Recommendation
Practical, insightfulâ€”definitely worth reading.

## Final Thoughts

While this issue may not have had quite the same punch as previous ones, it still delivered actionable insights. Key highlights for me were:

- The call for renewed CMS innovation.
- The growing importance of observability and OpenTelemetry.
- Practical Docker and LLM tips.
- A critical reminder about inclusivity and team resilience.

Worth picking upâ€”especially if you're interested in keeping your PHP skills sharp and broadening your thinking beyond the immediate code.
